    "    goal is to create script that takes in a message and encrypts it using the rlce encryption method\n",

    "    for the sake of simplicity, this code works with a binary matrix defined by GF(2)\n",

    "    definitions\n",
    "        m - message vector of length k\n",
    "        n - codeword length\n",
    "        Gs - generator matrix k X n\n",
    "        t - number of errors that linear code can correct\n",
